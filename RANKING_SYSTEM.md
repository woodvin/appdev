- **250-499 Games**: +15% bonus
- **100-249 Games**: +10% bonus

### Example XP Calculation
```
Player Profile:
- Base XP Reward: 1000

## Examples

### Example 1: Skilled Player
```
Player A:
- Total XP: 800,000
- Win Rate: 65%
- Games Played: 300

Performance Bonus: +30% (win rate) + 15% (activity) = +45%
Effective XP: 800,000 √ó 1.45 = 1,160,000
Rank: Gold I (requires 1,000,000 effective XP)
```

### Example 2: Casual Player
```
Player B:
- Total XP: 1,200,000
- Win Rate: 45%
- Games Played: 80

Performance Bonus: 0% (win rate) + 5% (activity) = +5%
Effective XP: 1,200,000 √ó 1.05 = 1,260,000
Rank: Gold I (barely qualified)
```

### Example 3: Pro Player
```
Player C:
- Total XP: 5,000,000
- Win Rate: 72%
- Games Played: 600

Performance Bonus: +40% (win rate) + 20% (activity) = +60%
Effective XP: 5,000,000 √ó 1.60 = 8,000,000
Rank: Diamond III (jumped ahead!)
```

## Strategy Tips

### For Fast Rank Progression:
1. **Maintain High Win Rate** (60%+) for massive bonuses
2. **Play Consistently** to build activity bonus
3. **Focus on Winning** over grinding losses
4. **Build Streaks** for compounding XP gains
5. **Play at Higher Ranks** to earn more XP per win

### For Competitive Players:
- A 70% win rate with 500 games = **2x effective XP**
- This means you rank up **twice as fast** as someone with the same XP but poor performance
- Winners with streaks can earn **3x+ XP per activity**

```

## Balancing Notes

### Current Balance:
- Progression feels rewarding for both casual and competitive players
- High skill = faster progression (up to 2x)
- Activity is rewarded but not required for rank
- Ranks are prestigious and visible

### If Ranks Feel Too Easy:
1. Increase XP requirements for higher tiers
2. Reduce performance bonus caps
3. Add minimum win rate requirements per rank

### If Ranks Feel Too Hard:
1. Increase performance bonus percentages
2. Lower XP requirements for lower tiers
3. Add more bonus sources (achievements, lessons, etc.)

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions:
- **Seasonal Rankings**: Reset ranks each season with special rewards
- **Decay System**: Lose rank if inactive for too long (Master+)
- **Placement Matches**: Initial calibration games for new players
- **Rank-Specific Rewards**: Exclusive avatars, titles, cosmetics
- **Tier Promotions**: Special rewards for crossing tier boundaries
- **MMR System**: Hidden matchmaking rating separate from visible rank
